## Course description

This course is for students who want to learn how to analyze, map, and model spatial data using the R programming language. It assumes students know some basic statistics through linear regression. It also assumes students have some prior experience with using R. Students without knowledge of R should seek help through online tutorials.

In this course we survey the methods used to describe, analyze, and model spatial data. Focus is on applications. Some emphasis is given to how spatial statistical methods are related.

Expected learning outcomes

1. Learn how to apply statistical methods and models to spatial data, 
2. learn about the various packages in R for analyzing and modeling spatial data, and 
3. learn how to interpret the results of a spatial data model. 

Course materials

* You will need access to the internet and a computer.
* All course materials are available through Canvas and GitHub.
* There is no required textbook.

Class meetings

- Remote lessons
- Remote/F2F problem sets

During each remote lesson I will work through and explain the R code within a lesson notes file. The lesson notes are comprehensive and you can work through them on your own. The notes are written using markdown. Markdown is a way to write content for the Web. Each lesson is contained in a file having the suffix `.Rmd` (an R markdown file). The file is opened with the RStudio application.

## Grades

You are responsible for:

1. Working through the R markdown files (`.Rmd`) files (you can do this during class as I talk or outside of class on your own) 
2. Handing in the problem sets on time

Grades are determined only by how well you do on the problem sets.

Grading standard

* A:  Outstanding: few, in any, errors/omissions
* B:  Good: only minor errors/omissions
* C:  Satisfactory: minor omissions, at least one major error/omission
* D:  Poor: several major errors/omissions
* F:  Fail: many major errors/omissions

I'll use the +/- grading system.

Grades are posted on * [FSU Canvas](https://canvas.fsu.edu)

## Reproducible research 

A scientific paper has at least two goals: announce a new result and convince readers that the result is correct. Scientific papers should describe the results _and_ provide a clear protocol to allow repetition and extension.

Analysis and modeling tools should integrate text with code to make it easier to provide a clear protocol of what was done.

* Such tools make doing research efficient. Changes are made with little effort.
* Such tools allow others to build on what you've done. Research achieves more faster.
* Collaboration is easier.
* Code sharing leads to greater research impact. Research impact leads to promotion & tenure.

Free and open source software for geospatial data has progressed at an astonishing rate. High performance spatial libraries are now widely available. 

However, much of it is still not easy to script. Open source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as QGIS (see https://qgis.org) have greatly reduced the 'barrier to entry' but emphasis on the Graphical User Interface (GUI) makes reproducible research difficult. 

Instead this course focuses on a Command Line Interface (CLI), enabling reproducible, and 'computational' workflows.

# Getting started

First get R

* Go to http://www.r-project.org.
* Select the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Scroll to a mirror site. 
* Choose the appropriate file for your hardware.
* Follow the instructions to install R.

Then get RStudio

* Go to on http://rstudio.org
* Download RStudio Desktop
* Install and open RStudio

Learn git

https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html

The RStudio IDE

* Written in HTML
* Top menus
  + File > New File > R Markdown
  + Tools > Global Options > Appearance
  
* Upper left panel is the markdown file. This is where we put our text and code. 
  + Run code chunks from this panel 
  + Output from the operations can be placed in this panel or in the Console (see the gear icon above)
  + All the text, code, and output can be rendered to an HTML file or a PDF or Word document (see the Knit button above)
  
* Upper right panel shows what is in your current environment and the history of the commands you issued.
  + This is also where you can connect to github
  
* Lower left panel is the Console
  + I think of this as a sandbox where you try out small bits of code. If it works and is relevant move it to the markdown file.
  + This is also where output from running code will be placed.
  + Not a place for plain text
  
* Lower right panel shows your project files, the plots that get made, and all the packages associated with the project.
  + The File tab shows the files in the project. The most important one is the .Rmd.
  + The Plot tab currently shows a blank sheet
  + The Packages tab shows all the packages that have been downloaded from CRAN and are associated with this project.

## Your assignments

Your assignments will be done inside an Rmd file.

1. Download the assignment Rmd from Canvas and rename it to `yourLastName_yourFirstName.Rmd`
2. Open the Rmd file with RStudio
3. Replace 'Your Name' with your name in the YAML
4. Answer the questions by typing the code between code-chunk delimiters
5. Select the Knit button to generate an HTML file
6. Fix any errors
7. Email me your Rmd file


The package **swirl** contains functions to help you learn the basics of R. The `install.packages` function gets the package from an CRAN mirror site. This needs to be done only once to your local computer. You can update packages using `update.packages`. To make the functions work in your current session you must use the `library` function. This needs to be done for every session, but only once per session.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
```

Type:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
swirl()
```

Getting help: https://www.r-project.org/help.html

Applied statistics is the analysis and modeling of data. Use the `c()` function to input small bits of data into R. The function combines (concatenates) items in a list together. For example, consider a set of hypothetical annual land falling hurricane counts over a ten-year period.

2  3  0  3  1  0  0  1  2  1

We get save these counts in our working directory by typing them into the console as follows. The console is the lower left window.
```{r}
counts <- c(2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1)
counts
```

We assign the values to an object called `counts`. The assignment operator is an equal sign (`<-` or `=`).  Values do not print. They are assigned to an object name. They are printed by typing the object name as we did on the second line. When printed the values are prefaced with a `[1]`. This indicates that the object is a vector and the first entry in the vector has a value of 2 (The number immediately to the right of `[1]`).

We use the arrow keys to retrieve previous commands. Each command is stored in the history file. The up-arrow key moves backwards through the history file. The left and right arrow keys move the cursor along the line.

We apply functions to data stored in objects.
```{r}
sum(counts)
length(counts)
sum(counts)/length(counts)
mean(counts)
```

The function `sum()` totals the number of hurricanes over all years, `length()` gives the number of elements in the vector. Other functions include, `sort()`, `min()`, `max()`, `range()`, `diff()`, and `cumsum()`. Try these functions on the landfall counts. What does `range()` function do?  What does `diff()` do?

The hurricane count data stored in the object `counts` is a vector. This means that R keeps track of the order that the data were entered. There is a first element, a second element, and so on. This is good for several reasons.

The vector of counts has a natural order; year 1, year 2, etc. We don't want to mix these. We would like to be able to make changes to the data item by item instead of entering the values again. Also, vectors are math objects so that math operations can be performed on them.

For example, suppose `counts` contain the annual landfall count from the first decade of a longer record.  We want to keep track of counts over other decades. This could be done by the following, example.
```{r}
d1 <- counts
d2 <- c(0, 5, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1)
```

Most functions operate on each element of the data vector at the same time.
```{r}
d1 + d2
```

The first year of the first decade is added from the first year of the second decade and so on.

What happens if we apply the `c()` function to these two vectors?  Try it.
```{r}
c(d1, d2)
```

If we are interested in each year's count as a difference from the decade mean, we type:
```{r}
d1 - mean(d1)
```

In this case a single number (the mean of the first decade) is subtracted from a vector. The result is from subtracting the number from each entry in the data vector. This is an example of data recycling. R repeats values from one vector so that the vector lengths match. Here the mean is repeated 10 times.
