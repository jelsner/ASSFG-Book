## Maps with tmap

So far we've used the `plot()` method as a first-order check on our geocomputations. It is possible to make a publishable quality map using `plot()` but there is a lot of trial and error in getting it to the quality needed. 

An efficient alternative is to use functions from the **tmap** package. There are other packages for making nice maps in R with some of them listed in the syllabus but I like the **tmap** package because it integrates `sf`, `sp`, and `raster` objects seamlessly. 
```{r chapter4}
library(tmap)
```

Like **ggplot2**, **tmap** uses the 'grammar of graphics'. The grammar separates the input data frame from the aesthetics (how data are visualised). The functions translate the data into aesthetics. The aesthetics can include the location on a geographic map (defined by the geometry), color, and other visual components.

All **tmap** maps start with the `tm_shape()` function that takes as input a spatial data frame. The function is followed by one or more layers such as `tm_fill()` and `tm_dots()` that defines how a property in the data gets translated to an aesthetic. 

Consider the New Zealand simple feature data frame (`nz`) from the **spData** package. Make the data frame available, check its class, and make a plot of the geometry.
```{r}
library(spData)

class(nz)
plot(nz$geom)
```

The geometry column is labeled `geom`. 

Check the native coordinate reference system (CRS) of the spatial data frame with the `st_crs()` function from the **sf** package.
```{r}
library(sf)

st_crs(nz)
```

The CRS is called the New Zealand transverse Mercator. The distance unit is meter (https://epsg.io/2193).

To make a **tmap** map we first identify the spatial data frame with the `tm_shape()` function and then add a borders layer.
```{r}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_borders() 
```

The borders separate New Zealand into 16 administrative regions.

The function `tm_shape()` and its subsequent drawing layers (here `tm_borders()`) as a 'group'. The data in the `tm_shape()` function must be a spatial object of class simple feature, raster, or an S4 class spatial object.

Here we use a fill layer instead of the borders layer.
```{r}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill() 
```

Here we layer using the fill aesthetic and then add a border aesthetic.
```{r}
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill(col = 'green') +
  tm_borders() 
```

Layers are added with the `+` operator and are functionally equivalent to an overlay.

We can assign the resulting map to an object. For example here we assign the map of New Zealand to the object `map_nz`.
```{r}
map_nz <- tm_shape(nz) + 
  tm_polygons()

class(map_nz)
```

The resulting object is of class `tmap`.

New spatial data are added with `+ tm_shape(new_object)`. In this case `new_obj` represents a new spatial data frame to be plotted over the preceding layers. When a new spatial data frame is added in this way, all subsequent aesthetic functions refer to it, until another spatial data frame is added.

For example, let's add an elevation layer to the New Zealand map. The elevation raster (`nz_elev`) spatial data frame is in the **spDataLarge** package on GitHub.

The `install_github()` function from the **devtools** package is used to install a package on GitHub. GitHub is a company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in code during software development.

Note, I've done this for you below (Do not run the code chunk below).
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("Nowosad/spDataLarge")
```

Make the data available.
```{r}
library(spDataLarge)
```

Next identify the spatial data for the the new layer by adding `tm_shape(map_nz)`. Then add the raster layer with the `tm_raster()` function and set the transparency level to 70% (`alpha = .7`).
```{r}
map_nz1 <- map_nz +
  tm_shape(nz_elev) + 
    tm_raster(alpha = .7)

map_nz1
```

The new map object `map_nz1` builds on the existing map object `map_nz` by adding the raster layer `nz_elev` representing elevation.

We can create new layers with functions. For instance, a function like `st_union()` operates on the `geometry` column of a simple feature data frame.

As an example, here we create a line string layer as a simple feature object using three geocomputation functions. We start by creating a union over all polygons (regions) with the `st_union()` function applied to the `nz` simple feature object. The result is a multipolygon defining the coastlines. 

Then we buffer this multipolgyon out to a distance of 22.2 km using the `st_buffer()` function. The result is a single polygon defining the coastal boundary around the entire country. 

Finally we change the polygon geometry to a line string geometry with the `st_cast()` function. The default in `st_cast()` is to simplify the geometry (e.g., a LINESTRING is simpler than a `POLYGON`).

The operations can be linked together with the pipe (`%>%`) from the **dplyr** package.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

nz_water <- st_union(nz) %>% 
  st_buffer(22200) %>% 
  st_cast(to = "LINESTRING")
class(nz_water)
```

Now we add the resulting spatial object as a layer to our map.
```{r}
map_nz2 <- map_nz1 +
  tm_shape(nz_water) + 
    tm_lines()

map_nz2
```

Finally, lets create a layer representing the country elevation high points (stored in the object `nz_height`) onto the `map_nz2` object with `tm_dots()` function.
```{r}
map_nz3 <- map_nz2 +
  tm_shape(nz_height) + 
    tm_dots()

map_nz3
```

### Example 1: What state contains the geographic centroid of tornado activity?

Import the tornado data. Remove Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico tornadoes. The native CRS is latitude/longitude so we transform it to a Web Mercator (EPSG 3857) used by Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing, ArcGIS, ESRI.
```{r}
Alltors.sfdf <- read_sf(dsn = "1950-2018-torn-initpoint") %>%
                  filter(!st %in% c("HI", "AK", "PR")) %>%
                  filter(yr >= 1994) %>%
                  st_transform(crs = 3857)
```

What is the geometry type in the simple feature column (`sfc`)?
```{r}
st_geometry(Alltors.sfdf)
```

The start location of the tornado track has a `POINT` geometry. The CRS specified by the EPSG number specifies a particular proj4string.

We use the `st_combine()` function to create a single feature column with a `MULTIPOINT` geometry. All the genesis locations are geometrically combined into a single `MULTIPOINT` simple feature (no attributes).
```{r}
single <- st_combine(Alltors.sfdf)
st_geometry(single)
```

Next we use the `st_centroid()` function to find the geographic center of the simple feature column.
```{r}
center <- st_centroid(single)
```

The result is a single feature of type `POINT`. In this case the order of operations is cummutative, but it is not in general.

To create a map, we first get a simple feature data frame (geometry type: `MULTIPOLYGON`) of the continental U.S. state borders from the **spData** package.
```{r}
library(USAboundaries)

States <- us_states() %>%
  filter(!state_name %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "District of Columbia"))
st_crs(States)
st_geometry(States)
```

CAUTION: The **spData** package contains a spatial data frame for getting state-level boundaries with the same name (`us_states`)!!

We note that the CRS of the state borders does not match the CRS of the tornadoes so we use the `st_transform()` function with the argument `crs = st_crs(Alltors.sfdf)`.
```{r}
States <- st_transform(States, 
                       crs = st_crs(Alltors.sfdf))
```

Which state contains the centroid? The function `st_contains()` returns a `TRUE` for the state that contains the center.
```{r}
mtrx <- st_contains(States, 
                    center, 
                    sparse = FALSE)
```

The result is  a 48 x 1 matrix with all entries `FALSE` except the state containing the centroid.

Select the geometry containing the centroid.
```{r}
centerState <- States[mtrx[, 1], ]
plot(centerState$geometry)
```

Then to make a map using the functions from the **tmap** package we start with the state borders group, then add the tornadoes as a group with a dot layer, then add the state borders subsetted by the state containing the centroid, finally add the centroid location as a group with bubbles as a layer.
```{r}
tm_shape(States) +
  tm_borders() +
tm_shape(Alltors.sfdf) +
  tm_dots() +
tm_shape(States[mtrx, 1]) +
  tm_borders(col = "red") +
tm_shape(centerState) +
  tm_bubbles(size = .3, col = "red")
```

Note that we need to think about the order of the layers.

### Example 2: State-level tornado rates

Here we compute and display the annual tornado occurrence rate (per 10,000 square km) for each state.

Start by first determining the intersections of the state polygons and the tornado points.
```{r}
mtrx <- st_contains(States, 
                    Alltors.sfdf, 
                    sparse = FALSE)
dim(mtrx)
```

The result is a 48 (states) by 30,497 (tornadoes) matrix of logical values indicating whether or not each tornado occurred within each state.

Next we use the `rowSums()` function to get the total number of `TRUE` entries for each states.
```{r}
rowSums(mtrx)
```

The key is that the order of the elements from the `rowSums()` function matches the order of the states in `States`. 

Also see the `aggregate()` function (KBDI.Rmd).

So we include the counts as a column in the `States` simple feature data frame. We include the area of each state. This allows us to compute the rate per 10,000 sq. km. The spatial unit is meter so areas are in sq. meter. To change square meter to square kilometer we multiply by 10 billion (10^10).
```{r}
nT <- rowSums(mtrx)
StateArea <- st_area(States)

States <- States %>%
  mutate(nT,
         rate = nT/StateArea/(2018 - 1994 + 1) * 10^10)
head(States)
```

Then we make a map. Here since all the information is in a single spatial data frame `States` we only have one group. The group has two layers; borders and fill. The fill layer has the color aesthetic pointed to the column labeled 'rate'.
```{r}
tm_shape(States) +
  tm_borders(col = "gray70") +
  tm_fill(col = "rate",
          title = "Annual Rate\n[/10,000 sq. km]") +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```

Note: functions from **tmap** (1) expect data as spatial objects rather than data frames and (2) variable names need to be surrounded by quotes.

All functions start with `tm_`. The first function in a group needs to be `tm_shape()`. It specifies the spatial object. Functions following `tm_shape()` specify sequential aesthetics as layers. Layers are divided into base and derived.

Base layers

* `tm_polygons()`: Draws polygons; 	col
* `tm_symbols()`: Draws symbols;	size, col, shape
* `tm_lines()`:	Draws polylines;	col, lwd
* `tm_raster()`:	Draws a raster;	col
* `tm_text()`:	Add text labels;	text, size, col

Derived layers

* `tm_fill()`:	Fills the polygons;	see `tm_polygons()`
* `tm_borders()`:	Draws polygon borders;	none
* `tm_bubbles()`:	Draws bubbles;	see `tm_symbols()`
* `tm_squares()`:	Draws squares;	see `tm_symbols()`
* `tm_dots()`:	Draws dots;	see `tm_symbols()`
* `tm_markers()`:	Draws markers;	see `tm_symbols()` and `tm_text()`
* `tm_iso()`	Draws iso/contour lines;	see `tm_lines()` and `tm_text()`

Each aesthetic (layer) can take a constant value or a data variable name. For instance, `tm_fill(col = 'green')` colors all polygons green, while `tm_fill(col = "var1")`, where `"var1"` is the name of a data variable in the shape object, creates a choropleth. If a vector of constant values or variable names are provided, the output is a set of maps.

The following layers are cartographic elements:

* `tm_grid()`:	Add coordinate grid lines
* `tm_credits()`:	Add credits text label
* `tm_compass()`:	Add map compass
* `tm_scale_bar()`:	Add scale bar

For example here we create a choropleth map of countries using an index of happiness.
```{r}
data(World)

tm_shape(World) +
    tm_polygons(col = "HPI")
```

The simple feature spatial object `World` is the only required argument in the `tm_shape()` function. A polygon layer is added where the fill color (`col =`) is set to the column `HPI` in the attribute table of the simple feature data frame.

The legend title is set with the `title =` argument. For example, here we create a title with the `expression()` and `paste()` functions then use the title in the `tm_fill()` function. Here we also use `tm_fill()` plus `tm_borders()` rather than the `tm_polygons()` as the layer.
```{r}
legend_title <- expression(paste("Area (km", {}^2, ")"))
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill(col = "Land_area", 
          title = legend_title) +
  tm_borders()
```

The default are sensible breaks. The argument `breaks =` sets the breaks manually. The argument `n =` sets the number of bins into which numeric variables are categorized. The `palette =` argument defines the color scheme, for example `BuGn` from the **RColorBrewer** package.

### Map layout, facets, and inserts

Layout functions help create a cartographic map. Elements include the title, the scale bar, margins, aspect ratios, etc. For example, here elements such as a north arrow and a scale bar are added with `tm_compass()` and `tm_scale_bar()`, respectively and the `tm_layout()` function is used to add the title and background color.
```{r}
map_nz + 
  tm_compass(type = "8star", 
             position = c("left", "top")) +
  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 100, 200), 
               text.size = 1) +
  tm_layout(title = "New Zealand",
            bg.color = "lightblue")
```

Faceted maps (referred to as 'small multiples') are composed of several maps arranged side-by-side. Facets enable the visualization of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable.

For example, here the faceted variable is time (`year`). The simple feature data frame is from the **spData** package. We first filter the data frame keeping only the years 1970, 1990, 2010, and 2030.
```{r}
urb_1970_2030 <- urban_agglomerations %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 1990, 2010, 2030))
```

Note: The operator `%in%` acts like a recursive or. If year == 1970 or year == 1990, ... For example, 
```{r}
1969:2031 

1969:2031 %in% c(1970, 1990, 2010, 2030)
```

We then make a map.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(world) + 
  tm_polygons() + 
tm_shape(urb_1970_2030) + 
  tm_symbols(col = "black", 
             border.col = "white",
             size = "population_millions") +
  tm_facets(by = "year", 
            nrow = 4, 
            free.coords = FALSE)
```

The above code chunk demonstrates key features of faceted maps created with functions from the **tmap** package.

* Shapes that do not have a facet variable are repeated (the countries in world in this case).
* The `by =` argument which varies depending on a variable (`year` in this case).
* nrow/ncol setting specifying the number of rows (and columns) that facets should be arranged into.
* The `free.coords =` argument specifies whether each map has its own bounding box.

Small multiples are also generated by assigning more than one value to one of the aesthetic arguments. For example here we map the happiness index (`HPI`) and gross domestic product per capita (`gdp_cap_est`).
```{r}
tm_shape(World) +
    tm_polygons(c("HPI", "gdp_cap_est"), 
        style = c("pretty", "kmeans"),
        palette = list("RdYlGn", "Purples"),
        title = c("Happy Planet Index", "GDP per capita")) 
```

Two maps are created each with a different scale. All arguments of the layer functions can be vectorized, one for each small multiple map. Arguments that normally take a vector, such as `palette =`, are placed in a `list()`.

Multiple map objects can also be arranged in a single plot with the `tmap_arrange()` function.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
map1 <- tm_shape(World) +
           tm_polygons("HPI", 
                       style = "pretty",
                       palette = "RdYlGn",
                       title = "Happy Planet Index") 

map2 <- tm_shape(World) +
           tm_polygons("gdp_cap_est", 
                       style = "kmeans",
                       palette = "Purples",
                       title = "GDP per capita") 

tmap_arrange(map1, map2)
```

### Example 3: Tornado locations by month

Suppose we want a map showing the location of tornadoes by month. First add the world map with countries as a polygon layer (fill is gray by default). Then overlay the U.S. country polygons and color them white. Then add the tornado genesis locations as dots faceted by month. Then add the state polygons as borders. Use a North American Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area Projection and make this the master layer. Finally add cartographic elements.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons() +
tm_shape(world[world$name_long == "United States", ]) +
  tm_polygons(col = "white") +
tm_shape(Alltors.sfdf) +
  tm_dots() + 
  tm_facets(by = "mo", as.layers = TRUE) +
tm_shape(States, is.master = TRUE) + 
  tm_borders() +
  tm_compass(type = "arrow", position = c("left", "bottom")) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left", "bottom"), text.size = .75) +
  tm_style("natural") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Contiguous U.S. Tornadoes [1950-2018]",
            main.title.position = "center", main.title.size = .85,
            panel.labels = month.name) +
  tm_credits(c(rep("", 11), "Data Source: U.S. SPC"), 
             position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

We can clearly see the spread of tornado activity from the southeast in January to the central Plains in May to the northern Plains during July and August and then back to the southeast in December.

### Inset map

An inset map is a smaller map set within or next to the main map. An inset map is used to contextualize the geographic study area. Here we create a map of the central part of New Zealand's Southern Alps. The inset map shows where the main map is in relation to all of New Zealand. 

The first step is to define the area of interest. Here it is done here by creating a new spatial object `nz_region` using the `st_bbox()` function and the `st_as_sfc()` to make it a simple feature column.
```{r}
nz_region <- st_bbox(c(xmin = 1340000, xmax = 1450000,
                       ymin = 5130000, ymax = 5210000),
                     crs = st_crs(nz_height)) %>% 
  st_as_sfc()
```

The second step is to create a base map showing New Zealand's Southern Alps area. This is the closeup view of where the most important message is stated. The region is clipped to the simple feature column `nz_region` created above. The layers include a raster of elevations and locations of high points. A scale bar is included.
```{r}
nz_height_map <- tm_shape(nz_elev, 
                          bbox = nz_region) +
  tm_raster(style = "cont", 
            palette = "YlGn", 
            legend.show = TRUE) +
  tm_shape(nz_height) + 
  tm_symbols(shape = 2, 
             col = "red", 
             size = 1) +
  tm_scale_bar(position = c("left", "bottom"))

nz_height_map
```

The third step is to create the inset map. It gives a context and helps to locate the area of interest. This map clearly indicates the location of the main map.
```{r}
nz_map <- tm_shape(nz) + 
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(nz_height) + 
  tm_symbols(shape = 2, 
             col = "red", 
             size = .1) + 
  tm_shape(nz_region) + 
  tm_borders(lwd = 3)

nz_map
```

The final step is to combine the two maps. The `viewport()` function from the **grid** package is used to give a center location (x and y) and the size (width and height) of the inset map.
```{r}
library(grid)

nz_height_map
print(nz_map, 
      vp = viewport(.8, .27, width = .5, height = .5))
```

### Turn a static map into an interactive map

Leaflet is a popular open-source platform (javascript) for making/serving interactive maps. The **leaflet** package provides access to the platform.

As an example, here we create a world map by using the default mapping arguments in `leaflet()` and zoomable tiles with the `addTiles()` layer. The piping operator (`%>%`) is used to 'add' layers. 
```{r}
library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles()
m
```

Note: if the map doesn't render in your Viewer tab, then click the `Viewer` tab and select "Show in new window".

Here we use `setView()` with longitude and latitude arguments in decimal degrees to center the map on FSU and use a zoom of 17.
```{r}
m <- m %>%
  setView(lng = -84.29849, 
          lat = 30.44188, 
          zoom = 17)
m
```

A cool feature of **tmap** is that we can create an interactive map using the same code as we used to create a static map. 

For example our static map of New Zealand (`map_nz`) is viewed interactively by switching to view mode.
```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
map_nz
```

With the interactive mode turned on, all maps produced with **tmap** will launch as zoomable HTML. This feature includes the ability to specify the basemap with `tm_basemap()` (or `tmap_options()`) as demonstrated here.
```{r}
map_nz + 
  tm_basemap(server = "OpenTopoMap")
```

Q: Why is there no topography for New Zealand?

We can also create interactive maps with the `tmap_leaflet()` function.

The view mode in **tmap** works with faceted plots. The argument sync in `tm_facets()` is used to produce multiple maps with synchronized zoom and pan settings.
```{r}
world_coffee <- left_join(world, 
                          coffee_data, 
                          by = "name_long")
tm_shape(world_coffee) + 
  tm_polygons(c("coffee_production_2016", 
                "coffee_production_2017")) + 
  tm_facets(nrow = 1, sync = TRUE)
```

Change the view mode back to plot.
```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

### Example 4: Tornado occurrences on a grid

Import the tornado data convert it to geographic coordinates.
```{r}
Alltors2.sfdf <- st_read(dsn = "1950-2018-torn-aspath") %>%
                       filter(!st %in% c("HI", "AK", "PR")) %>%
                       filter(yr >= 2014 & mag >= 0)
```

Create the leaflet map with a view set on campus. First use the `addTiles()` function and then the `addPolylines()` function with the argument `data = Alltors2.sfdf`. The piping operator is used to add layers.
```{r}
m <- leaflet() %>% 
  setView(-84.29849, 30.44188, zoom = 17) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(data = Alltors2.sfdf)
m
```
  
We can also use the `mapView()` function from the **mapview** package. It also provides interactivity for easy and quick visualization during spatial data analysis. But it is not intended for fine-tuned presentation quality map production.
```{r}
library(mapview)

mapView(Alltors2.sfdf, 
        zcol = "mag")
```

Use `mapView()` to create an interative map of tornado counts on a raster. First create a raster of grid cells at a resolution of a quarter of a degree latitude and longitude. Use the `rasterize()` function from the **raster** package to count the number of tornado occurrences in each cell. 

We first create the raster with a cell resolution of 1/4 degree. We specify `field = "om"` so the result is a raster layer rather than a raster brick (all variables in `Alltors2.sfdf`).
```{r}
library(raster)

r <- raster(xmn = -125, xmx = -67, 
            ymn = 24, ymx = 50)
res(r) <- .25
Tor_r <- rasterize(x = Alltors2.sfdf, 
                   y = r, 
                   field = "om",
                   fun = "count")
```

Finally use the `mapView()` function to create the interactive map.
```{r}
mapView(Tor_r,
        alpha.regions = .35)
```

## Maps with ggplot

The package **ggplot2** supports `sf` objects with the function `geom_sf()`. The syntax is similar to that used by **tmap** functions. An initial `ggplot()` function followed by one or more layers, that are added with `+`. The layers begin with `geom_`.

For example, here we plot a choropleth map of the median income by region across New Zealand and add a layer indicating elevation heights.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = nz, aes(fill = Median_income)) +
  geom_sf(data = nz_height) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(170, 175))
```

The function `geom_sf()` uses the `geometry` column of the simple feature data frame. It does not work with S4 spatial data frames. 

The function automatically plots graticules (lines of latitude and longitude) labels. The default settings for the graticules can be overridden using `scale_x_continuous()`, `scale_y_continuous()` or `coord_sf(datum = NA)`.

An advantage of using functions from the **ggplot2** package for mapping is that the package has a strong user-community and there are many add-on packages. And they have just tripled the speed of this function that will be available with the next version of **ggplot2**

The maps (and plots) from **ggplot2** are given a level of interactivity when printed using the function `ggplotly()` from the **plotly package**. Try `plotly::ggplotly(g1)`, for example.
```{r}
g1 <- ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = nz, aes(fill = Median_income)) +
  geom_sf(data = nz_height) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(170, 175))
plotly::ggplotly(g1)
```

But **ggplot2** has a few drawbacks for making maps. The `geom_sf()` function does not always produce a nice legend. Raster objects are not supported and need to be converted into a data frame before plotting.

## Cartograms

A cartogram is a map where the geometry is proportionately distorted to represent a variable. We can create cartograms with functions in the **cartogram** package. 

The `cartogram_cont()` function creates continuous area cartograms. It accepts an `sf` object and name of the variable (column) as inputs. Additionally, the maximum number of iterations for the transformation can be set with the `intermax =` argument. 

For example, here we represent median income in New Zealand’s regions as a continuous cartogram/
```{r}
library(cartogram)

nz_carto <- cartogram_cont(nz, 
                           weight = "Median_income", 
                           itermax = 5)
tm_shape(nz_carto) + 
  tm_polygons("Median_income")
```

We create non-contiguous cartograms using `cartogram_ncont()` and Dorling cartograms using `cartogram_dorling()`. Non-contiguous area cartograms are created by scaling down each region based on a weighting variable.
```{r}
States <- spData::us_states

States2163 <- st_transform(States, 
                           crs = 2163)
States2163_ncont <- cartogram_ncont(States2163, 
                                    "total_pop_15")
tm_shape(States2163_ncont) +
  tm_polygons("total_pop_15")
```

Dorling cartograms consist of circles with areas proportional to the weighting variable.
```{r}
States2163_dorling <- cartogram_dorling(States2163, 
                                        "total_pop_15")
tm_shape(States2163_dorling) +
  tm_polygons("total_pop_15")
```

**Challenge** The file *sids2.zip* contains shapefiles indicating the number and rate (per 10,000 births) of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) by county in North Carolina. Load the data as a simple features spatial object and make small multiple choropleth maps of the SIDS rates in 1974 and 1979 (`SID74` and `SID79` variables) using functions from the **tmap** package. Create a continuous cartogram of the SIDS rates in 1979.

Import the data.
```{r}
download.file("http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/sids2.zip",
              "sids2.zip")
unzip("sids2.zip")
sids.sf <- read_sf(dsn = "sids2")
st_crs(sids.sf) <- 4326
sids.sf <- st_transform(sids.sf, crs =  3857)
```

Small multiple maps
```{r}
tm_shape(sids.sf) +
  tm_polygons(c("SID74", "SID79"))
```

Cartogram
```{r}
sids_carto <- cartogram_dorling(sids.sf, "SID79")
tm_shape(sids_carto) + 
  tm_polygons("SID79",
              title = "Per 10K live births") +
  tm_compass(type = "8star", 
             position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

## Coordinate systems

This needs to be changed to reflect the new WKT proj strings, etc.

[See](https://www.r-bloggers.com/geographic-projections-and-transformations/)

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) defines how the spatial elements of the data relate to the surface of the Earth. CRSs are either geographic or projected.

Geographic coordinate systems identify any location on the Earth's surface using longitude and latitude. Longitude is location in the east-west direction in angular distance from the Prime Meridian. Latitude is angular distance north or south of the equator. Distance in geographic CRSs are not measured in meters.

The surface of the Earth in geographic coordinate systems is represented by a spherical or ellipsoidal surface. Spherical models assume that the Earth is a perfect sphere of a given radius. Spherical models have the advantage of simplicity but are rarely used because they are inaccurate. Ellipsoidal models are defined by two parameters: the equatorial radius and the polar radius.

Ellipsoids are part of a wider component of CRSs: the datum. This contains information on what ellipsoid to use (with the `ellps` parameter in the proj4 CRS library) and the precise relationship between the cartesian coordinates and location on the Earth's service. These additional details are stored in the `towgs84` argument of proj4 notation (see proj4.org/parameters.html for details). These allow local variations in Earth's surface, e.g. due to large mountain ranges, to be accounted for in a local CRS. 

There are local and geocentric datums. In a local datum such as NAD83 the ellipsoidal surface is shifted to align with the surface at a particular location. In a geocentric datum such as WGS84 the center is the Earth’s center of gravity and the accuracy of projections is not optimized for a specific location. Available datum definitions are seen by typing
```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_proj_info(type = "datum")
```

### Projected coordinate systems

Projected CRSs are based on Cartesian coordinates on a flat surface. They have an origin, x and y axes, and a unit of distance (meter). All projected CRSs are based on a geographic CRS, described in the previous section, and rely on map projections to convert the three-dimensional surface of the Earth into Easting and Northing (x and y) values in a projected CRS.

This transition cannot be done without adding some distortion. Therefore, some properties of the Earth’s surface are distorted in this process, such as area, direction, distance, and shape. A projected coordinate system can preserve only one or two of those properties. Projections are often named based on a property they preserve: equal-area preserves area, azimuthal preserve direction, equidistant preserve distance, and conformal preserve local shape.

There are three main groups of projection types - conic, cylindrical, and planar. In a conic projection, the Earth's surface is projected onto a cone along a single line of tangency or two lines of tangency. Distortions are minimized along the tangency lines and increase with the distance from those lines in this projection. Therefore, it is the best suited for maps of mid-latitude areas. A cylindrical projection maps the surface onto a cylinder. This projection could also be created by touching the Earth’s surface along a single line of tangency or two lines of tangency. Cylindrical projections are used most often when mapping the entire world. A planar projection projects data onto a flat surface touching the globe at a point or along a line of tangency. It is typically used in mapping polar regions. A list of projection types is available by typing
```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_proj_info(type = "proj")
```

### CRSs in R

We describe a CRS in R with an epsg code or with a proj4string definition. An epsg code is shorter, and therefore easier to remember. The code also refers to only one, well-defined coordinate reference system. On the other hand, a proj4string definition allows more flexibility. This way you can specify many different projections, and modify existing ones. This also makes the proj4string approach more complicated. The epsg code points to one and only one CRS.

Spatial packages support a wide range of CRSs and they use the long-established proj4 library. Other than searching for EPSG codes online, another quick way to find out about available CRSs is via the `rgdal::make_EPSG()` function, which outputs a data frame of available projections. Before going into more detail, it's worth learning how to view and filter them inside R, as this could save time on the internet. The following code will show available CRSs interactively, allowing you to filter ones of interest (try filtering for the OSGB CRSs for example):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
crs.data <- rgdal::make_EPSG()
View(crs.data)
```

With simple features the CRS of an object can be retrieved using `st_crs()`. For example:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
filepath <- system.file("vector/zion.gpkg", package = "spDataLarge")
sf.poly <- st_read(filepath)
```

Our new object is a polygon representing the borders of Zion National Park (`?zion`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_crs(sf.poly) # get CRS
```

In cases when a coordinate reference system (CRS) is missing or the wrong CRS is set, the `st_set_crs()` function can be used:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
sfdf <- st_set_crs(sf.poly, 26912) # set CRS
```

The warning message informs us that the `st_set_crs()` function does not transform data from one CRS to another.

The `projection()` function can be used to access CRS information from a Raster* object:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
projection(new.raster) # get CRS
```

The same function, `projection()`, is used to set a CRS for raster objects. The main difference, compared to vector data, is that raster objects only accept proj4 definitions:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
projection(new.raster) = "+proj=utm +zone=12 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs" # set CRS
```

### Units

An important feature of CRSs is that they contain information about spatial units. Clearly it is vital to know whether your house is measured in feet or meters. The same applies to maps. It is good cartographic practice to add a scale bar onto maps to demonstrate the relationship between distances on the page or screen and distances on the ground. Likewise, it is important to formally specify the units in which the geometry data or pixels are measured to provide context, and ensure that subsequent calculations are done in context.

A novel feature of geometry data in simple feature objects is that they have native support for units. This means that distance, area and other geometric calculations return values that come with a units attribute, defined by the units package (Pebesma, Mailund, and Hiebert 2016). This is advantageous because it prevents confusion caused by the fact that different CRSs use different units (most use meters, some use feet). Furthermore, it also provides information on dimensionality, as illustrated by the following calculation which reports the area of Nigeria:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(spData)
nigeria <- world[world$name_long == "Nigeria", ]
st_area(nigeria)
```

The result is in units of square meters (square meters), showing a) that the result represents two-dimensional space and b) and that Nigeria is a large country. This information, stored as an attribute is advantageous for many reasons, for example it could feed into subsequent calculations such as population density. 

Reporting units prevents confusion. To take the Nigeria example, if the units remained unspecified, one could incorrectly assume that the units were in square kilometers. To translate the huge number into a more digestible size, it is tempting to divide the results by a million (the number of square meters in a square kilometer):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_area(nigeria) / 10^6
```

However, the result is incorrectly given again as square meters. The solution is to set the correct units with the units package:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
units::set_units(st_area(nigeria), km^2)
```

Units are of equal importance in the case of raster data. However, so far the **sf** package is the only spatial package that supports units, meaning that people working on raster data should approach changes in the units of analysis (for example, converting pixel widths from imperial to decimal units) with care. The `new.raster` object (see above) uses a UTM projection with meters as units. Consequently, its resolution is also given in meters but you have to know it, since the `res()` function simply returns a numeric vector.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
res(new.raster)
```

If we use the WGS84 projection, the units change.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
repr <- projectRaster(new.raster, crs = "+init=epsg:4326")
res(repr)
```

Again, the `res()` command gives back a numeric vector without any unit, forcing us to know that the unit of the WGS84 projection is decimal degrees.
